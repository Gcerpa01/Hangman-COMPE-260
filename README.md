# Hangman
This a text based format game of hangman. It choses a word at random from it's word list that can be modified and then asks the user for guesses as to what the word is. The game only accepts letters and not words. 

There are multiple caveats to this coding of the game. Primarily There is no visual representation of a hangman like in a traditional game as well as no
display of the letters the player has already chosen, meaning they can guess incorrectly multiple times with the same letter. 

Additionally, project graders posted that there are instances in which the game will not end at 9 incorrect guesses and will only end once the word is guessed correctly
